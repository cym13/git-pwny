Description
===========

Recovers the content of a git repository through a wrongly vulnerable web
server.

Why ?
=====

The case happened on a pentest, this was a POC used to demonstrate that in
such circumstances it is possible to recover all server-side source code as
well as the history. If Nmap warns you about a .git directory being
accessible know that this is a real issue.

Documentation
=============

Usage: git-pwny.sh DOMAIN

Argument:
    DOMAIN  Url to access the .git directory (without /.git/)

License
=======

The code is under the WTFPL (see http://www.wtfpl.net/) License.
